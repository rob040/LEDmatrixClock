Optional default Credentials to be autoloaded into Config Portal to use or change instead of manually input. Credentials are saved in LittleFS, SPIFFS or EEPROM. New powerful-yet-simple-to-use feature to enable adding dynamic custom parameters from sketch and input using the same Config Portal. MultiResetDetector as well as Virtual Switches feature permits entering Config Portal as requested. Configurable Custom HTML Headers, including Custom Style, Custom Head Elements, CORS Header.
